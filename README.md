# Honours Project Code Listing
The purpose of this application is to facilitate easier testing of machine learning techniques.
Many of the scripts included in this code listing will not be usable because the datasets they depend on are too large to be included here. They will be available on the following github profile: github.com/breay200

## Requirements
Prior to running the program, it is necessary to install the prerequisite libraries.
Run the following command in the base directory
1) pip install -r requirements.txt

This project was made using Python 3.8.6, it is recommended that the same version is used too.

## How to use the program
1) Open the Command Prompt (on windows) in the directory of the code listing
2) In the command prompt enter the following: py main.py
3) The user will then be prompted by the program's interface.

## Where are results stored?
Under the performance_results folder. These can be viewed within the main program or outwith.
NB: Using the a text editor to view the results may be confusing as the data is not labelled.

Each line of text in performance results corresponds to the following evaluation metrics:
Precision Score
Recall Score
Matthew's Correlated Coefficient
Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve scores
F1 Score
Time to train
Misclassified samples
Accuracy
